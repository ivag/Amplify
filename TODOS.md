# TODOS

### Badges

1. Make badges for the controls

### Tabs

1. Make a tab interface like gmail. Tabs can be scrollable left/right
2. Make badges for the tabs that are not currently in focus. A red badge will denote that there are some errors in the tab. Focusing on the tab will clear the badge.

### Grid

1. Make sure large numbers and dates are cut off when they overflow, or use ellipsis. On hover, show the full contents of the table cell.
2. Make the edit buttons appear when you hover over the field.
3. Make the columns resizable.
4. When fields change automatically, make a glowing animation to alert the user where a change happened.


### Lists

1. Live rendering of items
2. Multiple select on normal lists


### Labels

1. Labels of controls that are required are marked with a red asterisk. When they are filled in, change the label into a green check mark


# FIXES

1. IE adds extra padding to buttons
2. Make wheel scrolling faster
